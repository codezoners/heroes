  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> Elektra Natchios (UK: /ˈnætʃiɒs/, US: /-oʊs/) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books
      published by Marvel Comics. Created by Frank Miller, the character first appeared in Daredevil #168 (January 1981).
      She is a love interest of the superhero Daredevil, but her violent nature and mercenary lifestyle divide the two.

The character is a highly trained assassin of Greek descent who wields a pair of bladed sai as her trademark weapons.
Elektra is one of Frank Miller's best-known creations, but subsequent writers' use of her is controversial as Marvel had
 originally promised to refrain from reviving the character without Miller's permission.[2] She has also appeared as a
 supporting character of the X-Men's Wolverine and in other series and mini-series, as well as adaptations for the screen.

In the 2003 film Daredevil and its 2005 spin-off, Elektra, the character is portrayed by Jennifer Garner. Élodie Yung
portrays the character in the second season of Marvel's Daredevil[3] and The Defenders (2017) for the Marvel Cinematic
Universe.[4]

  <h2> More Information</h2>
  <img src="Elektra character.png" style="width: 100%;"> </img>
<p> Elektra is a 2005 Canadian-American superhero film directed by Rob Bowman. It is a spin-off from the 2003
  film Daredevil, starring the Marvel Comics character Elektra Natchios (portrayed by Jennifer Garner). The story
  follows Elektra, an assassin who must protect a man and his prodigy daughter from another assassin
  who was hired by The Hand.

For the screenplay, Raven Metzner, Zak Penn, and Stuart Zicherman received "written by" credit. Mark Steven Johnson
received credit for "motion picture characters" and Frank Miller for "comic book characters." Filming started around May
2004 in Vancouver.[3]

The film was released on January 14, 2005. Upon its release, Elektra was a commercial and critical failure, grossing
$56 million against a production budget of $43 million. It received generally-negative reviews from critics, who found
the script and storyline lacking, but many praised Garner's acting as well as the action sequences.[4]

  <h2>Analysis</h2>
</div>
<p> When acclaimed writer-artist Frank Miller began his celebrated run on the Marvel title, Daredevil, no one knew
  what to expect. They certainly didn't realize that a seemingly meek Greek college student by the name of Elektra would
  become one of the most popular and memorable characters in the post-modern, increasingly adult world of comic books.Telling the
  story of how the death of her father drove an innocent, naive college student into a deadly trained martial arts assassin,
  this seminal work stands alone among the great stories to ever be produced in the graphic storytelling medium. Elektra became
  so popular, in fact, that even after her death, interest in the character was so high that a yearlong, multi-part epic was
  created entirely for her. Elektra: Assassin was immediately recognized as being like nothing that had come before. The fragmented,
  complex script by Miller was both dramatically compelling and darkly satirical.
