          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <a href="../html-link.htm"><img src="big hero 6 poster.jpg"
             style="width:50%;" title="Big hero 6 poster"
             alt="Big hero 6"></a>

          <p> Baymax is the deuteragonist of Big Hero 6. He is a healthcare robot built by Tadashi Hamada and a member
          of the superhero team Big Hero 6.

          Baymax was created by the brilliant Tadashi Hamada as a healthcare providing nurse to
          improve healthcare around the world.To provide Baymax his programming and personality, Tadashi
          generated a healthcare chip encoded with the inscriptions that made
          Baymax the health-oriented and lovable robot he truly is. The chip also prevents Baymax from
          harming humans willingly; without it, this limit is compromised.Baymax is instantly activated by
          the sound of distress, and can only deactivate once his current patient states "I am satisfied with
          my care." If not, he will not stop helping nor leave unless the patient confirms their satisfaction.<p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-sm-4  col-sm-offset-0"> <!-- the length of the blank boxes-->
          <h2>More information</h2>
            <a href="../html-link.htm"><img src="Baymax.jpg"
               style="width:80%;" title="Baymax"
               alt="Baymax"></a>

          <p>The overall appearance is designed to be soft and non-threatening so that he can assist his patients without
          harming them. He appears as a wide robot covered in inflatable vinyl material, causing his outward
          appearance to resemble, as Hiro calls him, a big marshmallow. But his "true" appearance, which can only
          be seen by looking deep inside the vinyl, is a flexible carbon-fiber skeleton covered in plastic and wires
          with thick limbs holding the rest of his body together. The skeleton also has a projector in its chest for
          Baymax to display. Baymax's head is relatively simple-looking, consisting of only two "eyes" (actually
          hyperspectral cameras) and a mouth-esque line connecting them. His access port is on the left side of his
          chest, and can be recognized by its badge-like appearance. In it are four slots, so Baymax can hold up to
          four different program chips.<p>
        </div>

          <h2>Character background</h2>
            <a href="../html-link.htm"><img src="inflatable robot.jpg"
             style="width:80%;" title="inflatable robot"
             alt="robot"></a>

          <p>The character design of Baymax was inspired by hardcore robot research in a Pittsburgh lab. In 2011,
          Carnegie Mellon University scientist Siddharth Sanan, working with Mike Ornstein and Justin B. Moidel,
          under the guidance of Professor Christopher Atkeson, built a functioning, inflatable robot arm — a
          breakthrough in what is known as soft robotics. Soft robotics provide a number of real-world benefits,
          some of which are illustrated in Big Hero 6. In the movie, Baymax is a care-giver robot that attempts
          to take care of a boy, often by holding and picking him up.<p>
